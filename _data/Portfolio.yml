  - title: "Word Embeddings from scratch using CBOW"
    description: 
      - This project aimed to implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) method for generating
        word embeddings using PyTorch. The primary objective was to understand how to create dense
        representations of words that encode semantic relationships, which could be applied in various
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks
