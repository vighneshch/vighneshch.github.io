    description: 
      This project aimed to implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) method for generating
      word embeddings using PyTorch. The primary objective was to understand how to create dense
      representations of words that encode semantic relationships, which could be applied in various
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks
      - "Technology Used: Python,Pytoech,Torchtext,Git"
